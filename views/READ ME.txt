I feel like you guys are confused by the naming so here's a tldr so you dont need to open index.js anymr

viewAssignment_0 - page from Agent POV where the assignment they are viewing are still not submitted/approved
viewAssignment_1 - Agent POV where the ass they are viewing is already submitted (can't edit, no other buttons)
viewAssignment_2 - Agent POV for printing
viewAssignment_3 - Agent POV approved

viewAssignment_0_admin - Admin POV comment=submitted (they can comment on it/send back/approve so that they can go to print it)
viewAssignment_1_admin - Admin POV comment=approved (therefore they can't comment on it/send back)
viewAssignment_2_admin - Admin POV comment="New!" (button to save details)
viewAssignment_3_admin - Admin POV comment=anything else (no buttons)
viewAssignment_4_admin - Admin POV comment="For Printing" (button going to /admin-approve

assignments - Agent POV, page to show when the agent is allowed to accept any assignment listed
assignments_cant_accept - Agent POV, page to show when the agent is NOT allowed to accept any assignments (bc they have an ongoing ass)
